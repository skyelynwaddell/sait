Our travel agency has 4 agents. We will need to display their Rate of Pay. 
We will need available booking times and a count of seats per flight that can be bought.
For vacations we would like to display all the content of the location they are traveling,
such as the Place Name, Duration of Stay, and a short blurb describing the vacation.
We would like to also display the package price. I'd like to also display all the customers, and their data
including the package history, and any current packages.
Each individual will display their full name, family size, amount of pets, and account details including
username and password.
