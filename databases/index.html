                <h2>
                    A collection of data & info organized into tables with columns and rows.
                    <br>
                    Situation description has nouns, verbs, and modifiers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Every table should have a unique id.
                    <br>
                    Table Types:
                    <br>
                    NN : Not Null.
                    <br> 
                    ND : No Duplicates.
                    <br>
                    PK : Primary Key.
                    <br>
                    FK : Foreign Key.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Primary Keys : 
                    <br>
                    Every table must have a primary key.
                    <br>
                    Primary keys must not be null, must never be duplicated.
                    <br>
                    Multi-column primary key cans have duplicates in each single column, never in all columns combined.
                    <br>
                    Primary keys must never be changed, for example a user can never change their email, but they can delete it and remake it, or make a new email all together.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Noun: Identify the things we need to keep info about.
                    <br>
                    Verbs: Show how these things relate to or interact with each other.
                    <br>
                    Modifiers: Are individual data items that describe each of the thing in more detail.
                    <br>
                    Entity: Name of table including all fields.
                    <br>
                    Body: Record.
                    <br>
                    Relation : Is connection between two tables.
                    <br>
                    Attributes: A field in a table.
                    <br>
                    Primary Key: Unique ID of a table.
                    <br>
                    Foreign Key: The unique id of another table, but can be unique.
                    <br>
                    Composite Key: Usually has many - to - many relationships.
                    <br>
                    Say if there was no unique key , you can combine multiple fields of keys to make a unique an entry.
                    <br>
                    
                    <br>
                    Table Rules:
                    <br>
                    1. Table names must be unique.
                    <br>
                    2. Column names must be unique within a table.
                    <br>
                    3. Rows must be unique.
                    <br>
                    4. Columns must be non-decomposable. Should be as small as possible (ie. Name should be split in firstName and lastName)
                    <br>
                    5. Columns and Rows can be in any order.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Relationship details:
                    <br>
                    1:1 The entity and object can only have 1 relationship.
                    ie. License plate can only be assigned to one car, and a car can only be assigned to one license plate. 
                    <br>
                    1:M Entity one can have many relationships with an object that can only have 1 relationship with entity / vice versa.  
                    ie. A student can have 
                    <br>
                    M:M Entity and Object may both have multiple relationships.
                    ie. A Purchase order can have multiple items, and Users can have multiple Purchases.

                    Normalization: is the steps/rules/practice to reduce redundancy and null values truly.
                    <br>
                    NF (stand for Normal Form)

                    Developed by DR. E.F. Codd from IBM in 1970.
                    <br>
                    A progressive refinement of database structures.
                    <br>
                    Transforms complex data structures into simple data structs. 
                    <br>
                    To minimize redundant data.
                    <br>
                    Minimize NULL values.
                    <br>
                    Enable Extensions without needing major redesign.
                    <br>
                    minimize modification anomalies.
                    <br>
                    Make queries easier and less limited.
                    <br><br>
                    Three main forms of normalization:
                    <br>
                    First Normal Form: No repeating columns. Primary key must be unique.
                    <br>
                    Second Normal Form: Every non key column identified by the entire primary key. (this comes into effect when we have a multi-column primary key)
                    <br>
                    Third Normal Form: Every non key column depends on only the primary key.
                    <br>
                    If a non-key column is uniquely identified by another non-key column it should be moved to a table that is keyed by that column.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What is an Entity Relationship Diagram
                    <br>
                    A map of a database that shows all the relationships between the different tables inside the database.
                    <br>
                    - A variety of formats.
                    <br>
                    - No single industry standards.
                    <br>
                    - Each company will have its own standard depending on the tool they use.
                    <br>
                    You can use Draw.IO or Microsoft Visio to create an ERD.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    ER Diagram Attributes:
                    <br>
                    - Listed below Entity name.
                    <br>
                    # : Unique identifier.
                    * : Mandatory attribute.
                    o : Optional attribute.
                    <br>
                    example:
                    <br>
                    Product Table = {
                        #* SKU, (must be unique, and is mandatory)
                        ProductName, 
                        o Description Name,
                    }

                    <br>
                    Common naming conventions used in ERD.
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    1-M (must have atleast 1) (same as below)
                    <br>
                    1-* (must have atleast 1)

                    0 = zero / optional.
                    0 | = Can have 0 to 1.
