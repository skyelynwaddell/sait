\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hey, here is how you can traverse the file paths for my projects\
\
/project1 > contains the first travel agency project without any backend.\
//ATTENTION: Project1 must be served on Apache or through Live Server in VSCode, when just opening the HTML some elements do not work. (I had been testing and developing it with Live Server in VSCode).\
\
/basicnodeproject > contains the greetings to serve different routes in node.js\
\
/project2/server > contains my Node Project , SQL Database connection, and Templated website\
(You can find the SQL file in the root of /project2)\
\
/project2/may30 > was just an extra server I built to follow along with in class\
\
/kick-clone > I developed this responsive static website over the weekend which served as a template i converted into templating with EJS for the node project.\
\
I also included some entity relationship diagrams for the node project database to give an idea of how I would build it.\
I used usernames as primary key, and included them in each table just for ease of convenience of retrieving usernames while doing queries, while understanding they should have used an auto incrementing value as the primary key in an optimal setting.\
\
//Setup\
Please run NPM install\
Start script : npm run dev}
